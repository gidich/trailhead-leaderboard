## About:

This is a simple application to help gain adoption of trailhead by allowing your team to see stats in the same manner as a gaming leaderboard.

This entire application can run **for free** on Heroku.


## Quickstart:

1. Click the **Deploy to Heroku** button

    [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

    - For **App Name**, specify a name for your application. For example, if you specify sample-trailhead-leaderboard, your application will be available at http://sample-trailhead-leaderboard.herokuapp.com. Your app name has to be unique on the herokuapp.com domain.
    - Click the **Deploy App** button
    
2. Configure the schedule: (this keeps the leaderboard up to date daily)

## Additional Details, how to run locally

It is good to follow Heroku's [node.js tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) to get an understanding of how node.js works on Heroku and to configure your local environment.

Grab a copy of the code 


You'll want to create your own **.env** file with the MongoDB URI in it:

    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://<<username>>:<<password>>@<<your instance>>.mlab.com:<<port number>>/<<your instance>>

Run `npm install` in the directory you've downloaded

There is a `launch.json` file part of the project to make it easy to debug with VSCode, run in VS code and look at the Debug Console to see what port it is running at (typically 5000) open your web browser to http://localhost:5000 and view it locally.

## Troubleshooting Helpful notes:

**Error Logs**

To view error logs:

    heroku logs --tail -a <<appname>>

**Kill Local Instance**

To kill the local development environment:

Sometimes the local heroku development enviornment may die in the background, [this stackoverflow tip](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33048784/heroku-open-puma-port-5000-already-in-use-rails) was helpful:

Lists all processes on port 5000:

    lsof -i :5000 

Find the PID and then kill the process with this command:

    sudo kill -9 <<pid>>

**Best Performance**

For best performance, ensure that the app is running in production mode (it should be already by default):

    heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production -a <<your app aname>>
